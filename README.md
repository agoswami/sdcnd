# Finding Lane Lines on Road

This project aims to create a pipeline to find lane lines overlaying on the video we get from road camera from inside of the car. I am submitting jupyter notebook file "P1.ipynb", python piepilne file "Term1-P1-Finding-Lanes.py" and "writeup_template.md" file.

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
