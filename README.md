# Finding Lane Lines on Road

This project aims to create a pipeline to find lane lines by overlaying it on the video, we get from road facing camera from point of view of car. I am submitting jupyter notebook file "P1.ipynb", python pipeilne file "Term1-P1-Finding-Lanes.py" and "writeup_template.md" file.
